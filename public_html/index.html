		<h1>Joanne's Home Page</h1>
		My name is Joanne and I am a third year student undertaking the BS32011 Practical Project to learn more about coding and databases.
		<p>This is my first webpage and I am using it to practice HTML so that I can make a particular webpage.</p>
		<p>The final webpage will be a database describing information on a data set based on cystic fibrosis.<p>
		<h2><b>Bioinformatics Project</b></h2>
		A variety of exercises have enabled me to learn new IT skills in terms of programming and creating documents from a console alone, as well as how to link up data tables and use HTML formatting to create my own webpage.
		This webpage allows me to practice formatting and using <i>italic</i> writing.
